Create the user:

# useradd michael
Generate a key pair for him:

# ssh-keygen -b 2048 -t rsa -f key -C michael
Above command will create tow files: key and key.pub

Create .ssh directory for michael and copy the .pub file as below:

# su - michael
# mkdir .ssh && cd .ssh
# cat > authorized_keys < key.pub
# chmod 0700 ~/.ssh; chmod 0600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
Handover key to michael. This is nothing but the private key. Usually AWS appends .pem to the private keys.

Now michael can login with private key key as below:

ssh -i key michael@<ec2_host_name>
